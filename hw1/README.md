Create a UML Class diagram that depicts the following:
1.    A car whose attributes are current speed, current direction, and current location; and whose methods are Accelerate(toSpeed), Decelerate(toSpeed), and Turn(direction, degrees)
2.    A truck whose attributes and methods are the same as the car, but with the additional attribute of loadWeight and the additional method SetLoadWeight(weight)
In an object-oriented language of your choice, encode the above
•    The methods can just be empty for now, e.g. {}
•    The program should compile error free, but does not have to do anything (for now!)
